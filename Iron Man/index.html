        A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures,
        20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990,
        before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the
        project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount
        Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and
        faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title
        role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March
        to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from
        numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque
        environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own
        dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action.
        Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's
        company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title
        character.

        Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the
        United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It
        grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of
        2008. The film received praise from critics, especially for Downey's
        performance. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of
        the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st
        Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Two
        sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).
